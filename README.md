## 📌 Abstract
PhysioTrack is an intelligent, integrated system designed to improve the home rehabilitation experience for knee injury patients through accurate monitoring, interactivity, and motivation. Statistics show that nearly 50% of patients struggle with adhering to home exercise routines, and over 70% of knee injuries require consistent physiotherapy. Additionally, more than 60% of patients face psychological challenges such as anxiety or depression during recovery.  

The system uses IMU and pressure sensors to track movements in real time, with AI providing instant audio feedback for correction. Through virtual reality, patients engage with a virtual trainer in a gym-like environment. To boost motivation and mental well-being, users earn points to customize a virtual character, making therapy both effective and engaging.

---

## 🎯 Key Features
- Real-time motion tracking using **IMU & pressure sensors**  
- **AI-powered feedback** for accurate exercise correction  
- **Virtual Reality trainer** in an interactive 3D environment  
- Gamified reward system (points & avatar customization)  
- Progress tracking with performance reports  
- Designed for both patients and physiotherapists

## 🥽 GUI & Visualization
The system integrates a **virtual coach (3D character)** inside the VR environment.  
This coach demonstrates each exercise step-by-step, helping patients visually understand how to perform movements correctly.  

To further support learning, **illustrative diagrams** are displayed for each exercise, allowing patients to compare the correct vs. incorrect posture.  

By connecting the **ONNX-trained model** to the main character, which was trained on real squat exercise videos, the system is able to:  
- Provide **instant feedback** (audio/visual) on whether the patient is performing the movement correctly.  
- Highlight the **accuracy percentage** of the performed exercise in real time.
